Elena stood at the edge of the cliff, her silver hair dancing in the wind. The ancient city sprawled below, its towers reaching toward the darkening sky. She could feel the weight of destiny pressing down on her shoulders.

"Are you ready?" Marcus asked, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. His weathered face showed concern, but his eyes held unwavering trust.

She turned to face him, determination burning in her bright blue eyes. "I've been ready for this my entire life. Everything has led to this moment."

The wind picked up, carrying with it the scent of rain and something else—something ancient and dangerous. Elena's hand moved instinctively to the hilt of her sword.

Suddenly, a massive shadow swept across the valley. The temperature dropped. Birds scattered from the trees in a panicked frenzy. The dragon had arrived.

Elena drew her sword, the blade gleaming with ethereal light. Ancient runes along its length began to glow, responding to her resolve. This was the moment everything had led to.

Marcus readied his bow, silver arrows catching the last rays of sunlight. Each arrow was blessed, forged specifically for this battle. "Together," he whispered, his voice steady despite the fear.

"Together," Elena echoed, and they charged forward into destiny.

The dragon's roar shook the very foundations of the earth. But Elena didn't falter. She had trained for this. She was ready.
